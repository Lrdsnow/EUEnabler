### Notes:
- if it doesnt work the first time it wont work until there is an update
- if you have attempted to change your country in the past or have mismatched regions on your phone (ex. us wifi but german icloud) it will NOT work everything needs to be set to YOUR CURRENT country (aka YOUR LOCATION)
